# Example Workflow Template (Software Development)

# This is an EXAMPLE - not a requirement.
# Claude-evolve adapts to ANY domain dynamically.
#
# You can:
# - Delete these examples if not needed
# - Create your own templates for your domain
# - Let Claude suggest phases dynamically (recommended)

  Building new features from requirements to implementation.
  This workflow ensures clarity, planning, and quality before shipping.

complexity: medium-high

phases:
  - name: clarify
    goal: Clarify requirements and constraints
    suggested_approaches:
      - "Explore existing codebase for patterns"
      - "Use brainstorming skill if available"
    deliverable: Clear problem statement with acceptance criteria
    skip_if: Requirements already crystal clear from user
    questions:
      - What problem does this feature solve?
      - Who uses it and how?
      - What are the constraints (performance, security, compatibility)?
      - What does success look like?

  - name: plan
    goal: Plan implementation approach
    suggested_approaches:
      - "Analyze codebase architecture"
      - "Create implementation plan"
      - "Use writing-plans skill if available"
    deliverable: Implementation plan with file changes identified
    skip_if: Simple change with obvious implementation, pattern already known
    questions:
      - What existing patterns should we follow?
      - What files need to change?
      - Are there edge cases to consider?
      - What's the testing strategy?

  - name: execute
    goal: Write the code
    suggested_approaches:
      - "Write tests alongside implementation"
      - "Use test-driven-development skill if available"
    deliverable: Working code with tests
    skip_if: Never skip implementation
    questions: []

  - name: verify
    goal: Ensure quality before completion
    suggested_approaches:
      - "Run all tests"
      - "Review code for issues"
      - "Use verification skill if available"
    deliverable: Tests passing, code reviewed
    skip_if: Trivial change with no risk
    questions:
      - Do all tests pass?
      - Is the code clean and maintainable?
      - Are edge cases handled?
      - Is documentation needed?

triggers:
  - "implement"
  - "build"
  - "add feature"
  - "create"
  - "develop"
  - "add support for"
  - "new feature"

skip_for:
  - bug fixes (use bug-investigation workflow)
  - config changes (usually single-phase)
  - simple refactors (use refactoring workflow)
  - documentation only
