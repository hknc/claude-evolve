  Exploring codebases, technologies, or approaches before implementation.
  Focus on understanding and documenting findings.

complexity: low-medium

phases:
  - name: scope
    goal: Define what we're trying to learn
    suggested_approaches:
      - "Clarify research questions"
      - "Define success criteria"
    deliverable: Clear research questions
    skip_if: Question is already specific and focused
    questions:
      - What are we trying to understand?
      - What will we do with this knowledge?
      - How deep do we need to go?

  - name: explore
    goal: Gather relevant information
    suggested_approaches:
      - "Explore codebase systematically"
      - "Search for relevant patterns"
      - "Use code exploration agents if available"
    deliverable: Raw findings and observations
    skip_if: Never skip exploration
    questions:
      - Where is this implemented?
      - How does it work?
      - What patterns are used?
      - What are the edge cases?

  - name: synthesize
    goal: Make sense of findings
    suggested_approaches:
      - "Organize findings into coherent understanding"
      - "Identify trade-offs and recommendations"
      - "Use brainstorming skill if available"
    deliverable: Organized understanding with recommendations
    skip_if: Findings are simple and self-explanatory
    questions:
      - What did we learn?
      - How does this affect our approach?
      - What trade-offs exist?
      - What's the recommendation?

triggers:
  - "how does"
  - "what is"
  - "explore"
  - "understand"
  - "research"
  - "investigate how"
  - "investigate architecture"
  - "learn about"
  - "analyze"
  - "where is"
  - "find"

skip_for:
  - implementation tasks (use feature-development)
  - bug fixes (use bug-investigation)
  - refactoring (use refactoring workflow)

# Reasoning context for Claude
reasoning_hints:
  depth_indicators:
    deep:
      - Architecture decisions
      - Technology evaluation
      - Performance analysis
    medium:
      - Understanding a module
      - Learning a pattern
      - Comparing approaches
    shallow:
      - Finding a file
      - Checking a value
      - Quick lookup
  recommend_full_workflow_when:
    - Research will inform significant decisions
    - Multiple stakeholders need to understand
    - Findings need to be documented
  efficient_shortcuts:
    - Single-question research -> Skip scope
    - Clear findings -> Skip synthesize
    - Already familiar with area -> Lighter explore
